# Biped

Biped is better Windows keyboard emulation software for Infinity Foot Control pedals (e.g. [these](https://www.amazon.com/Infinity-Digital-Control-Computer-USB2/dp/B002MY6I7G)).

The existing Pedable application lacks some features (multiple pedals down at once) and has some issues (dropping pedal up events).

This is a super simple alternative for those who want to send keyboard input with their foot pedals.


Biped includes a simple configuration GUI and runs persistently in the system tray.


### Installation and Use

Biped doesn't need to be installed and should be started directly. To start Biped

1) Download the latest Biped release from Releases, here:

  * https://github.com/fairfieldt/Biped/releases

2) Unzip the contents of `biped.zip` to your desired location.

3) Run `biped2.exe`.

4) Configure each pedal's keypress (e.g. left, center, right) in the GUI. Configuration is stored in the registery.

That's it! Once started, Biped will run in the system tray. To exit, right click on the system tray icon.

Enjoy!
