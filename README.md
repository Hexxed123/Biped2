# Biped
simple WIndows keyboard emulation for Infinity Foot Controls


The existing Pedable application lacks some features (multiple pedals down at once) and has some issues (dropping pedal up events).

This is a super simple alternative for those who want to send keyboard input with their foot pedals.


config.yaml allows you to set the key for each pedal left, middle, and right.  The keys need to be set as the hexidecial keyCode. (For now, this should obviously be better)

Make sure config.yaml is in the same directory as Biped.exe
