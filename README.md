# Biped
simple Windows keyboard emulation for Infinity Foot Controls


The existing Pedable application lacks some features (multiple pedals down at once) and has some issues (dropping pedal up events).

This is a super simple alternative for those who want to send keyboard input with their foot pedals.

Run Biped.exe and use the GUI to configure your pedals.  Configuration is stored in the registry.  Biped will run in the system tray; to
exit right click on the tray icon.
